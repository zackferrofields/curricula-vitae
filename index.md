I am a dedicated and innovative engineer with extensive experience building scalable applications across web, native, and server environments. I’m passionate about designing efficient, high-performance systems that scale and exploring modern paradigms like functional reactive programming (FRP), microservices, and automated build processes. Committed to continuous self-improvement, I embrace new challenges and learning opportunities to refine my skills and deliver forward-thinking, adaptable solutions.
