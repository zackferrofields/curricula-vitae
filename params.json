Currently pursuing interests in isomorphic applications, functional reactive programming (FRP), dev-ops, and the latest ECMAScript standards.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### Lead Developer - Senior Software Engineer, The BIO Agency – FEB 2014 - PRESENT.\r\n\r\n#### Premium Credit Point of Purchase (PoP)\r\n\r\nPoP is a `reactive` `event-driven` web application with a [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) architecture, for creating & managing financed insurance premiums. The application was composed of asynchronous data streams using functional programming paradigms such as pure functions, function composition, higher order functions, immutable state, etc. The application was continuous integration & deployed with GitHub, Travis CI and Docker Cloud.\r\n\r\n> `es2015`, `esNext`, `jsx`, `babel`, `RxJs`, `cssnext`, `postcss`, `tape`, `istanbul`, `node`, `docker`, `travis`\r\n\r\n#### CHEP Better Portfolio\r\n\r\n[myCHEP](https://youtu.be/DPBR-l0sYd8) is a suite of mobile-first Backbone/Marionette applications. The project used Bower to manager 3rd party library dependencies (Marionette, Zepto, Lodash, Polyglot). Grunt for automated build processes (bundling modules, compiling SCSS, minification, concatenation, running unit-test, code-coverage, etc) and continuous-integration with Jenkins and Maven.\r\n\r\n> `webpack`, `babel` `es2015`, `scss`, `backbone`, `marionette`, `lodash`, `karma`, `jasmine`, `jenkins`, `maven`, `tomcat`\r\n\r\n#### The BIO Agency website\r\n\r\n[thebioagency.com](http://thebioagency.com) is a responsive isomorphic application written in javascript. The stack, [docker-nginx-react](https://github.com/zackferrofields/docker-nginx-react), uses a `node` server with `koa` APIs and an `nginx` proxy, to implement a \"micro\" cache with HTTP `Cahce-Control`. The content was hosted on a separate upstream in GitHub  as `markdown` and compiled to html.\r\n\r\n> `node`, `react`, `jsx`, `es2015`, `babel`, `koa`, `nginx`, `docker`\r\n\r\n#### Sky Sports Soccer Quiz\r\n\r\nA `node` application using `express` to serve REST APIs for an Android/iPhone app and store data in a `mongo` database. The application was unit-tested with `mocha` (and `chai` BDD assertion) using `sinon` and `superagent`.\r\n\r\n> `node`, `espress`, `mongodb`, `mocha`, `sinon`, `superagent`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Senior Front-End Developer, AIS London – MAY 2013 - FEB 2014.\r\n\r\n**Dozenate:**\r\nAn `Android` alarm clock with charity micro-payments. The application was built for Android 4.0+. The proof-of-concept involved building custom UI components including an analogue clock with draggable dials for setting alarms. The app used “Just Test Giving” to send micro-payments to charities via SMS.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Developer, Skinkers / IMI Mobile – DEC 2011 - MAY 2013.\r\n\r\n**Barclays Bikes:**\r\nAn iOS and Android application for built using `Titanium` (Appcelerator). The app used real-time TFL data for locating bikes/docks and plotting the data on a map.\r\n\r\n**Affiliate Window:**\r\nA portal for Affiliate Window users to view stats and manage their accounts. The app was built with Ember and bundled using Cordova, for Android and iOS app stores.\r\n\r\n**Red Bull Racing Spy:**\r\nAn iOS app built with Titanium (Appcelerator) that aggregated Red Bull Raging content/feeds (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Software Engineer, Grapple Mobile – JUN 2010 - DEC 2011.\r\n\r\nBuilding mobile applications, with a single source (JavaScript, HTML and CSS) compiled to multiple platforms (iOS, Android Blackberry/J2ME) for clients including Microsoft, Pfizer, T-Mobile and Premier Inn.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### Southampton Solent University – 2007 - 2010.\r\n#### Upper Second BSC (Hons) Software Engineering",
