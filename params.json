I’m currently pursuing my interests in isomorphic applications, functional reactive programming (FRP), unidirectional data flow, and the latest ECMAScript standards `es2015` & `es2016`.\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE\r\n----------\r\n\r\n### Senior Software Engineer, The BIO Agency – FEB 2014 - PRESENT.\r\n\r\n####CHEP Better Portfolio\r\n\r\n[myChep](https://youtu.be/DPBR-l0sYd8) is a mobile-first web-portal for CHEP customers to manage their accounts. The project was developed and delivered using an agile process, with a successful MVP (phase 1) delivered in September. The front-end application was built on an MVC architecture and used an iterative `git-flow` process, to manage the life-cycle, continuously integrate and continuously deploy features to the client. This allowed the product to evolve over time and update with the latest ECMAScript standards (`es2015`).\r\n\r\n> `bower`, `npm`, `grunt`, `webpack`, `babel` `es2015`, `scss`, `backbone`, `marionette`, `lodash`, `karma`, `jasmine`, `jenkins`, `maven`, `tomcat`\r\n\r\n#### The BIO Agency website\r\n\r\n[thebioagency.com](http://thebioagency.com) is a responsive isomorphic application written in javascript. The stack, [docker-nginx-react](https://github.com/zackferrofields/docker-nginx-react), uses `node` & `koa` APIs and `nginx` proxy-pass to implement a \"micro\" cache defined by HTTP `Cahce-Control`. The content is hosted separately as an upstream in github `markdown` and compiled to html. \r\n\r\n> `node`, `react`, `jsx`, `es2015`, `es2016` `babel`, `koa`, `nginx`, `docker`, `docker-compose`\r\n\r\n#### Sky Sports Soccer Quiz\r\n\r\nA `node` application using `express` to serve REST APIs for an Android/iPhone app and store data in a `mongo` database. The application was unit-tested with `mocha` (and `chai` BDD assertion) using `sinon` and `superagent`.\r\n\r\n> `node`, `espress`, `mongodb`, `mocha`, `sinon`, `superagent`\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Senior Front-End Developer, AIS London – MAY 2013 - FEB 2014.\r\n\r\n**Dozenate:**\r\nAn `Android` alarm clock with charity micro-payments. The application was build for Android 4.0+. The proof-of-concept involved building custom UI components including an analogue clock with draggable dials for setting alarms. The app used “Just Test Giving” to send micro-payments to charities via SMS.\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Developer, Skinkers / IMI Mobile – DEC 2011 - MAY 2013.\r\n\r\n**Barclays Bikes:**\r\nAn iOS and Android application for built using `Titanium` (Appcelerator). The app used real-time TFL data for locating bikes/docks and plotting the data on a map.\r\n\r\n**Affiliate Window:**\r\nA portal for Affiliate Window users to view stats and manage their accounts. The app was built with Ember and bundled using Cordova, for Android and iOS app stores.\r\n\r\n**Red Bull Racing Spy:**\r\nAn iOS app built with Titanium (Appcelerator) that aggregated Red Bull Raging content/feeds (Tumblr, Twitter, Facebook)\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\n### Software Engineer, Grapple Mobile – JUN 2010 - DEC 2011.\r\n\r\nBuilding mobile applications, with a single source (JavaScript, HTML and CSS) compiled to multiple platforms (iOS, Android Blackberry/J2ME) for clients including Microsoft, Pfizer, T-Mobile and Premier Inn.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n--------------\r\n\r\n### Southampton Solent University – 2007 - 2010.\r\n#### Upper Second BSC (Hons) Software Engineering\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-70455219-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
