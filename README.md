PROFILE
-------

As a software engineer, with over five years experience, developing applications for multiple environments including web, native, hybrid and server. I’m currently pursuing my interests in isomorphic applications, functional reactive programming (FRP), unidirectional data flow, and the latest ECMAScript standards `es2015` & `es2016`.

EXPERIENCE
----------

### Senior Software Engineer, The BIO Agency – FEB 2014 - PRESENT.

####CHEP Better Portfolio

[myChep](https://youtu.be/DPBR-l0sYd8) is a mobile-first web-portal for CHEP customers to manage their accounts. The project was developed and delivered using an agile process, with a successful MVP (phase 1) delivered in September. The front-end application was built on an MVC architecture and used an iterative `git-flow` process, to manage the life-cycle, continuously integrate and continuously deploy features to the client. This allowed the product to evolve over time and update with the latest ECMAScript standards (`es2015`).

#### The BIO Agency website

[thebioagency.com](http://thebioagency.com) is a responsive isomorphic application written in javascript. The stack, [docker-nginx-react](https://github.com/zackferrofields/docker-nginx-react), uses `node` & `koa` APIs and `nginx` proxy-pass to implement a "micro" cache defined by HTTP `Cahce-Control`. The content is hosted separately as an upstream in github `markdown` and compiled to html.

#### Sky Sports Soccer Quiz

A `node` application using `express` to serve REST APIs for an Android/iPhone app and store data in a `mongo` database. The application was unit-tested with `mocha` (and `chai` BDD assertion) using `sinon` and `superagent`.
