PROFILE
-------

As a software engineer, with over five years' experience, developing applications for multiple environments including web, native, hybrid and server. I’m currently pursuing my interests in isomorphic applications, functional reactive programming, unidirectional data flow, and the latest ECMAScript standards `es2015` & `es2016`.

EXPERIENCE
----------

### Lead Developer - Senior Software Engineer, The BIO Agency – FEB 2014 - PRESENT.

#### Premium Credit Point of Purchase (PoP)

PoP is a `reactive` `event-driven` web application with a [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html) architecture, for creating & managing financed insurance premiums. The application was composed of asynchronous data streams using functional programming paradigms such as pure functions, function composition, higher order functions, immutable state, etc. The project repository was setup with [protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) and [required status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-required-status-checks/). [Pull-requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) would trigger
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to build, unit-test & report status before merging into develop. Commits to `develop` & `release`, triggered [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) automated builds to generated new tagged images, that where "continuously delivered" via [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/) to the develop & QA environment ([diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zackferrofields/zackferrofields.github.io/master/assets/CI%26CD.png))

#### CHEP Better Portfolio

[myCHEP](https://youtu.be/DPBR-l0sYd8) is a mobile-first web-portal for CHEP customers to manage their accounts. The project was developed and delivered using an agile process, with a successful MVP (phase 1) delivered in September. The front-end application was built on an MVC architecture and used an iterative `git-flow` process, to manage the life-cycle, continuously integrate and continuously deploy features to the client. This allowed the product to evolve over time and update with the latest ECMAScript standards (`es2015`).

#### The BIO Agency website

[thebioagency.com](http://thebioagency.com) is a responsive isomorphic application written in javascript. The stack, [docker-nginx-react](https://github.com/zackferrofields/docker-nginx-react), uses a `node` server with `koa` APIs and an `nginx` proxy, to implement a "micro" cache with HTTP `Cahce-Control`. The content was hosted on a separate upstream in github as `markdown` and compiled to html.

#### Sky Sports Soccer Quiz

A `node` application using `express` to serve REST APIs for an Android/iPhone app and store data in a `mongo` database. The application was unit-tested with `mocha` (and `chai` BDD assertion) using `sinon` and `superagent`.
